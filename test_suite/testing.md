# Creating testing environment

## Please follow the instructions below prior to test this deno module:

- [ ] Go to your terminal and verify that you can run the psql command:
- [ ] Invoke `psql -d <url from elephantSQL> -f ./test_suite/db_test_postgres_create.sql`. This will open the connection to your database and execute the SQL statements that will create tables in your database and populate them with rows of data. Make sure you let the script run all the way through. It will take a minute or two.
- [ ] please add your database url in the url in the file you want to run.
      _(will be updating this part after adding create table method.)_
